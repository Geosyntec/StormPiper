# Viewing Results with the Map Explorer
The map explorer module is the main access point for all the spatial resources that can be used to view existing infrastructure and water quality conditions.

## Viewing Layers

By default, the following layers are enabled:

* Stormwater facilities
* Stormwater facility delineations
* Stormwater subbasins

To view other layers select the layer icon on the left-hand menu. A new panel will display with available layers.
