# Using the Scenario Designer 

The Scenario Designer is used to create and evaluate potential new facilities or groups of facilities. It can be used to assess the potential performance of a new action, or compare various alternative actions. 

## Creating a New Scenario 

To create a new scenario, click **Create New Scenario** in the Scenario Designer page. A new window will open with a multi-step form where you can enter information about your scenario. The first step asks for basic information about your scenario. Enter this information, then click **Next.** 

### Creating a New Delineation. 

The next step is to create a new delineation. The new delineation represents the area that drains to a new facility. Enter a name for this new delineation and then click the **edit icon** on the map window. 

Use the stormwater upstream trace tool in  Tacomaâ€™s GIS system (AccessES) to identify the approximate upstream drainage area to the node where you plan to install the new facility. Draw the new delineation on the map. Double-click to complete the delineation. To delete a delineation after it has been completed, click the **delete icon** on the map window. 

Once you have finished creating the delineation, click **Next.**

### Creating a new facility  

The final step is to create a new BMP facility. Under the **Create a BMP** section, add water quality parameters and cost analysis parameters. See the section on [Editing Facility Data](#editing_facility_data) for instructions. 

Use the map to indicate the location for the new facility. Click the **Edit Icon** in the map window and then click on your desired location on the map. Save your location by clicking on the **Accept Edits** icon. Then click **Next** under the **Create a BMP** form. 

The new scenario will be summarized on the next screen. If everything looks good, click **Create Scenario** to save your scenario. On the next screen, be sure to click **Calculate Scenario WQ Results** to generate results.
